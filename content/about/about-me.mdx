# Hi! I'm Vivek.

I'm from Chennai, India. I'm 25 years old, and I am a Masters student of Computer Science at San Jose State University.
I design and build user-centric software, websites, games, and blended reality experiences that leverage cutting-edge technology like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Virtual Reality, and Internet of Things, with a focus on scalability, durability, cost efficiency, and maintainability using standardized industry conventions.

> I am a staunch believer that the user experience makes or breaks a product, and I am obsessed with bringing the best interests of the user to every design decision.

## My academics

Currently, I'm working towards graduating in Spring 2026 with a Master's degree in Computer Science. I maintain a CGPA of 3.9. At San Jose State, I facilitate and incubate innovative pedagogy projects using AI and XR, with faculty across various departments. With the Centre of Faculty Excellence and Teaching Innovation, I work on establishing curricula and course deliverables that embrace generative AI technology, and facilitating extended reality content for the classroom.

## My skills

Solving interesting problems using software is where I thrive.
My projects or ideas generally tend to target a specific demographic, which in turn, provides a clear problem statement.
But if I'm not hacking away at a project, you will find me learning something new.
Through my thirst for knowledge, I've collected quite a few tools on my proverbial software belt.
I've dipped my toes in plenty of tech stacks, ranging from frontend frameworks, to cloud infrastructure, to game engines.
