# Hi! I'm Vivek.

I'm from Chennai, India. I'm 25 years old, and I am a Masters student of Computer Science at San Jose State University.
I design and build user-centric software, websites, games, and blended reality experiences that leverage cutting-edge technology like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Virtual Reality, and Internet of Things, with a focus on scalability, durability, cost efficiency, and maintainability using standardized industry conventions.

> I am a staunch believer that the user experience makes or breaks a product, and I am obsessed with bringing the best interests of the user to every design decision.

## My work

I have professional work experience with <TechLogo name="java" followColorScheme /> Java and <TechLogo name="nodejs" followColorScheme /> JavaScript.
With the team at blibli.com, I used the <TechLogo name="spring" followColorScheme /> Spring framework for building backend microservices, and I've leveraged frontend web experiences using <TechLogo name="vuejs" followColorScheme /> Vue and <TechLogo name="react" followColorScheme /> React.
I have also developed and presented virtual reality prototypes using <TechLogo name="unity" followColorScheme /> Unity and <TechLogo name="cs" /> C#.
I've worked with <TechLogo name="gcp" followColorScheme /> Google Cloud Platform and <TechLogo name="aws" followColorScheme /> Amazon Web Services to host servers using <TechLogo name="kubernetes" /> Kubernetes and for object storage and processing.

## My academics

Currently, I'm working towards graduating in Spring 2026 with a Master's degree in Computer Science.
I maintain a CGPA of 3.85.

At San Jose State, I facilitate and incubate innovative pedagogy projects using AI and XR with faculty across various departments.
With the Centre of Faculty Excellence and Teaching Innovation, I work on establishing curricula and course deliverables that embrace generative AI technology, and facilitating extended reality content for the classroom.

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Technology at SRM Institute of Science and Technology in 2021, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.
At SRM, I was one of the board members of the student-run research group, SRM Next Tech Lab.
I was also the vice-chairperson of SRM's ACM SIGCHI Student Chapter, where we worked towards building a community of creative technologists interested in CHI.

With Unity and ACM, I conducted several beginner and intermediate workshops to unite students interested in game development and connect them with industry professionals.
I was officially recognized for my expertise in game development education by being invited to advise the faculty committee in charge of formulating the curriculum for the gaming technology specialization in SRM.

My undergraduate capstone research evaluated augmented reality as an e-learning tool. [Read more about it](/blog/terrarium)!

## My skills

Solving interesting problems using software is where I thrive.
My projects or ideas generally tend to target a specific demographic, which in turn, provides a clear problem statement.

If I'm not hacking away at a project, you will find me learning something new.
Through my thirst for knowledge, I've collected quite a few tools on my proverbial software belt.
I've dipped my toes in plenty of tech stacks, ranging from frontend frameworks, to cloud infrastructure, to game engines.

Here's every framework, language, tool, and service I have worked with.
