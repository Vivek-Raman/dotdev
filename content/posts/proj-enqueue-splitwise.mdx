Here is another quick weekend project.

Following my [extension](/blog/itemize-receipts) to automate filling receipts, I realized that to tackle a backlog of 80 receipts, I needed to create 80 expenses.
Splitwise currently limits the number of expenses you can create in one day to 5.
So I did a little testing to see if I can create the expenses every night as midnight rolls over using a scheduled job.

But what I found was that there was no limit on how many expenses I could create using the API.
This sounds like a major oversight or a scrappy frontend implementation of the free tier restriction.
Either way, it works out great for me.

# Privacy

- This is in no way affliated with Splitwise. I am a third-party.
- None of the services I offer or plan to offer will be monetized.
- I do not store or log your information.
- Any and all data you see flows directly between your browser and their servers.

# How to use

You'll need to set up a new app to get your credentials.

- Navigate to https://secure.splitwise.com/oauth_clients and log in.
- Select "Register your application".
- Fill in the required fields of the form.

| Form input              | Recommended value         |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Application Name        | Enqueue Splitwise         |
| Application Description | Created by vivekraman.dev |
| Homepage URL            | https://vivekraman.dev    |

- Select "Register and get API key".
- You should see your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret values.
  Use these to log in to my app.
- Pick a group to create the expenses in.
  I created a group just for this app, because you can edit the expense and move it to any group that needs it.
- Pick the number of records you'd like.
  It's capped at 50, but go easy.
- It'll need to wait one second between each creation, so be patient.
- You're all set! If you can't see them on an empty or settled group, you'll find the expenses under "Show settled expenses".

# Dear Splitwise,

If you're somebody at Splitwise reading this, hire me and I'll fix your bugs.
I have other ways of getting around limitations and ways to defend against them as well.
See me not as a threat but as an opportunity.
Much love!
