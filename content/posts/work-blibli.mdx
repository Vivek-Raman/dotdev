In the final semester of my undergraduate program, I secured an internship at Quinbay Technologies.
This expanded into a full-time software development engineer role after I graduated in August.
In this post, I want to expand on some of the coolest things I worked on in blibli.com, and I'm hoping to showcase my process tackling complex requirements.

# The product

Blibli.com is an ecommerce product popular in Indonesia.
They are also growing a presence in the hyperlocal scene.
Quinbay Technologies is a sister company to blibli.com that handles some of the development efforts.

# The technology

Blibli is built on a microservice architecture, with most services hosted on <TechLogo name="gcp" followColorScheme /> Google Cloud platform, and some on their data center on-premises.

Backend servers are written in <TechLogo name="java" followColorScheme /> Java and RxJava, using <TechLogo name="spring" followColorScheme /> Spring Boot, built into a Docker container and deployed using <TechLogo name="kubernetes" /> Kubernetes.

The frontend is build using the <TechLogo name="vuejs" followColorScheme /> Vue framework.
Various parts of the customer and seller interface are split into microsite repositories, which were built and uploaded into a <TechLogo name="gcp" followColorScheme /> GCS bucket.
They are then deployed via an <TechLogo name="nginx" /> nginx server.

# My contributions

## Customer order cancellation

My first big story in Blibli was to build the option for a customer to cancel their order.
Before my work, customers could only request a cancellation via customer service.
This was quite a complex task, and it introduced me to the intricacies of system design.

There was a pre-existing cancellation flow for sellers and customer service to cancel orders.
With some minor tweaks, it could be adapted for customers.
But the main difference in the experience was that customers would expect to cancel entire orders, while sellers and customer service could cancel individual items in an order.

The recommendation I received from my lead was to treat the existing cancellation flow as a black box.
The naive solution here would be to invoke the black box in a loop.
However, this black box was a slow operation, and invoking it multiple times would lead to a poor user experience.

After brainstorming with my lead, we decided that the simplest solution would be to defer the cancellation request to a background job, enqueueing the cancellation of each item via <TechLogo name="kafka" /> Kafka.
The user would be informed that the cancellation was being processed, and they would receive a notification once it was complete.
