In the final semester of my undergraduate program, I secured an internship at Quinbay Technologies.
This expanded into a full-time software development engineer role after I graduated in August.
In this post, I want to expand on some of the coolest things I worked on in blibli.com, and I'm hoping to showcase my process tackling complex requirements.
